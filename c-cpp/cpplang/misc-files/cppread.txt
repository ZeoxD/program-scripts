hello this is a text to be read by my cpp program. this file will be saved in txt format. 
this file will be read through file input and output system of cpp. this will be done through 
the fstream header file of cpp library. my cpp program will use different functions of fstream and 
iostream to read , write and modify the files. the files read through these fuctions and with the help of
fstream can be shown to console through iostream header file and the functions provided
